download the files as a zip

unzip using the program of your choice (i recommend 7zip) 

open about:debugging in firefox

select 'This Firefox' 

click 'Load Temporary Add-on'

select 'manifest.json' 

the extension should then be working. highlight some text and then press the 'Translate' popup button that appears afterwards. it'll send you to Google Translate. this is more of a macro than a real add-on, but it works
